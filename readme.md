# GraphQL Test Project

This is a test project that I am working on to learn about GraphQL. In this project, I am exploring the basics of GraphQL and how it can be used to build APIs for web and mobile applications.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with GraphQL and learn how to build APIs using this technology. Throughout this project, I will be experimenting with different GraphQL queries and mutations, and exploring how to integrate GraphQL with different frontend frameworks and libraries.

## Contents
This project will cover the following topics:

- **Setting up the Project**
- **Creating a Basic GraphQL API**
- **Exploring GraphQL Queries and Mutations**
- **Integrating with Frontend Frameworks and Libraries**

## Next Steps
Once I have completed this project, I will have a basic understanding of how GraphQL works and how it can be used to build APIs for web and mobile applications. I can then move on to more advanced topics and start building more complex applications using GraphQL.
